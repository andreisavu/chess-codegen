_Can a codegen agent develop a competitive chess playing program?_

Most people are unable to do it given a few weeks of time. A small number of people can and the resulting programs are small and elegant (e.g. [sunfish](https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish) is just 131 lines of code). Building this as a test to determine if we are approaching a threshold where agents can engage in non-trivial R&D work and maybe even come up with some fresh ideas via trial and error.
