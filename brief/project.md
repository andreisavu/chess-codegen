# Python Chess Engine from Scratch

## Overall Goal

The overarching objective of this project is to develop a fully functional chess engine implemented entirely using standard Python library functions. This means no external chess libraries or modules will be utilized. The development process will follow an iterative approach, incrementally adding features and improving the engine's capabilities over multiple phases.

## Project Scope

The final chess engine should be capable of the following:

### Core Chess Logic

- Represent the chessboard and its pieces accurately.
- Validate and execute legal moves according to the rules of chess.
- Detect check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions.
- Implement move generation, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

### Gameplay

- Play a complete game of chess against a human opponent or another chess engine.
- Provide an interface (e.g., text-based or potentially graphical) for user interaction.
- Optionally, support different time controls for games.

### Additional Features (Potential)

- Implement basic search algorithms (e.g., minimax with alpha-beta pruning) to improve move selection.
- Incorporate simple evaluation heuristics to assess board positions.
- Potentially add support for UCI (Universal Chess Interface) compatibility to interact with other chess programs.

## Iterative Development Approach

The project will be divided into multiple iterations, each focusing on specific milestones and building upon the previous ones. The initial iterations will concentrate on core functionality, ensuring a solid foundation before adding more complex features. This iterative process allows for flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement throughout development.
