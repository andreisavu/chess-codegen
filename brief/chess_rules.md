## Chess Rules

### Objective

The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and there is no legal move to remove the king from check.

### The Board

Chess is played on an 8x8 grid, with alternating light and dark squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.

At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged as follows:

- The second row (or rank) from each player is filled with pawns.
- The rooks occupy the corner squares, followed by the knights next to them, then the bishops, and finally the queen on her own color (white queen on a light square, black queen on a dark square) and the king on the remaining square.

### The Pieces

- **King**: Moves one square in any direction. The king cannot move into check.
- **Queen**: Moves any number of squares in any direction.
- **Rook**: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
- **Bishop**: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
- **Knight**: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square, with the option to move two squares on its first move. Pawns capture diagonally.

### Special Moves

- **Castling**: A move involving the king and either rook. The king moves two squares towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king. Castling can only occur if neither piece has moved before, there are no pieces between them, and the king is not in check.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture. If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, the opponent's pawn can capture it as if it had moved only one square forward.
- **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is promoted to any other piece (except a king), usually a queen.

### End of the Game

- **Checkmate**: The king is in check and there is no legal move to remove the king from check. This results in the end of the game, with the player delivering checkmate being declared the winner.
- **Stalemate**: The player to move has no legal moves and is not in check. The game is a draw.
- **Draw**: The game can also end in a draw under the following circumstances:

    - **Agreement**: Both players agree to a draw.
    - **Insufficient material**: Neither player has enough pieces remaining to force a checkmate (e.g., king vs. king, king and knight vs. king).
    - **Threefold repetition**: The same position occurs three times with the same player to move and the same possible moves available.
    - **Fifty-move rule**: Fifty consecutive moves have been made without a pawn move or a capture.
